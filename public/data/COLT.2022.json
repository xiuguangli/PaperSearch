      "abstract": "Classically, the continuous-time Langevin diffusion converges exponentially fast to its stationary distribution $\\pi$ under the sole assumption that $\\pi$ satisfies a PoincarÃ© inequality. Using this fact to provide guarantees for the discrete-time Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm, however, is considerably more challenging due to the need for working with chi-squared or RÃ©nyi divergences, and prior works have largely focused on strongly log-concave targets. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantees for LMC assuming that $\\pi$ satisfies either a LataÅ‚{}aâ€“Oleszkiewicz or modified log-Sobolev inequality, which interpolates between the PoincarÃ© and log-Sobolev settings. Unlike prior works, our results allow for weak smoothness and do not require convexity or dissipativity conditions."

      "abstract": "Depth separation results propose a possible theoretical explanation for the benefits of deep neural networks over shallower architectures, establishing that the former possess superior approximation capabilities. However, there are no known results in which the deeper architecture leverages this advantage into a provable optimization guarantee. We prove that when the data are generated by a distribution with radial symmetry which satisfies some mild assumptions, gradient descent can efficiently learn ball indicator functions using a depth 2 neural network with two layers of sigmoidal activations, and where the hidden layer is held fixed throughout training. By building on and refining existing techniques for approximation lower bounds of neural networks with a single layer of non-linearities, we show that there are $d$-dimensional radial distributions on the data such that ball indicators cannot be learned efficiently by any algorithm to accuracy better than $\\Omega(d^{-4})$, nor by a standard gradient descent implementation to accuracy better than a constant. These results establish what is to the best of our knowledge, the first optimization-based separations where the approximation benefits of the stronger architecture provably manifest in practice. Our proof technique introduces new tools and ideas that may be of independent interest in the theoretical study of both the approximation and optimization of neural networks."

Specifically, when the stochastic gradient is unbiased and has uniformly bounded $(1+\\kappa)$-th moment, for some $\\kappa \\in (0,1]$, we quantify the convergence rate of the Stochastic Mirror Descent algorithm with a particular class of uniformly convex mirror maps, in terms of the number of iterations, dimensionality and related geometric parameters of the optimization problem. Interestingly this algorithm does not require any explicit gradient clipping or normalization, which have been extensively used in several recent empirical and theoretical works. We complement our convergence results with information-theoretic lower bounds showing that no other algorithm using only stochastic first-order oracles can achieve improved rates. Our results have several interesting consequences for devising online/streaming stochastic approximation algorithms for problems arising in robust statistics and machine learning."

      "abstract": "Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) are a very popular method for training generative models to produce high quality synthetic data. While WGAN-GP were initially developed to calculate the Wasserstein 1 distance between generated and real data, recent works (e.g. [23]) have provided empirical evidence that this does not occur, and have argued that WGAN-GP perform well not in spite of this issue, but because of it. In this paper we show for the first time that WGAN-GP compute the minimum of a different optimal transport problem, the so-called congested transport [7]. Congested transport determines the cost of moving one distribution to another under a transport model that penalizes congestion. For WGAN-GP, we find that the congestion penalty has a spatially varying component determined by the sampling strategy used in [12] which acts like a local speed limit, making congestion cost less in some regions than others. This aspect of the congested transport problem is new, in that the congestion penalty turns out to be unbounded and depends on the distributions to be transported, and so we provide the necessary mathematical proofs for this setting. One facet of our discovery is a formula connecting the gradient of solutions to the optimization problem in WGAN-GP to the time averaged momentum of the optimal mass flow. This is in contrast to the gradient of Kantorovich potentials for the Wasserstein 1 distance, which is just the normalized direction of flow. Based on this and other considerations, we speculate on how our results explain the observed performance of WGAN-GP. Beyond applications to GANs, our theorems also point to the possibility of approximately solving large scale congested transport problems using neural network techniques."

Additionally, we introduce an oracle that can learn the number of components of $G$ in asymptotically fewer queries than learning the full partition, thus answering another question posed by the same authors. Lastly, we introduce a more applicable version of this oracle, and prove asymptotically tight bounds of $\\widetilde\\Theta(m)$ queries for both learning and verifying an $m$-edge hidden graph $G$ using it."

It is widely assumed that a trade-off between computational complexity and regret is unavoidable, with Coverâ€™s Universal Portfolios algorithm, SOFT-BAYES and ADA-BARRONS currently constituting its state-of-the-art Pareto frontier. In this paper, we present the first efficient algorithm, BISONS, that obtains polylogarithmic regret with memory and per-step running time requirements that are polynomial in the dimension, displacing ADA-BARRONS from the Pareto frontier. Additionally, we resolve a COLT 2020 open problem by showing that a certain Follow-The-Regularized-Leader algorithm with log-barrier regularization suffers an exponentially larger dependence on the dimension than previously conjectured. Thus, we rule out this algorithm as a candidate for the Pareto frontier. We also extend our algorithm and analysis to a more general problem than online portfolio selection, viz. online learning of quantum states with log loss. This algorithm, called SCHRODINGERâ€™S-BISONS, ibs the first efficient algorithm with polylogarithmic regret for this more general problem."

The main contribution is a precise nonasymptotic assessment of the estimation error appearing in the PAC-Bayes bound. Our analysis is sharp enough to lead to minimax rates of estimation over Sobolev smoothness classes."

First observed in the deep learning literature, we show that such a phenomenon can be precisely characterized in the context of kernel methods, even though the resulting optimization problem is convex. Specifically, we consider the minimization of a quadratic objective in a separable Hilbert space, and show that with early stopping, the choice of learning rate influences the spectral decomposition of the obtained solution on the Hessianâ€™s eigenvectors. This extends an intuition described by Nakkiran (2020) on a two-dimensional toy problem to realistic learning scenarios such as kernel ridge regression. While large learning rates may be proven beneficial as soon as there is a mismatch between the train and test objectives, we further explain why it already occurs in classification tasks without assuming any particular mismatch between train and test data distributions."

Recent work of Diakonikolas et al.

We strengthen this result by improving the tolerance requirement to $n^{-\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\log k)}$. This lower bound is essentially best possible since an SQ algorithm of Klivans et al. (2008) agnostically learns this class to any constant excess error using $n^{O(\\log k)}$ queries of tolerance $n^{-O(\\log k)}$. We prove two variants of our lower bound, each of which combines ingredients from Diakonikolas et al. (2021) with (an extension of) a different earlier approach for agnostic SQ lower bounds for the Boolean setting due to Dachman-Soled et al. (2014). Our approach also yields lower bounds for agnostically SQ learning the class of \"convex subspace juntas\" (studied by Vempala, 2010) and the class of sets with bounded Gaussian surface area; all of these lower bounds are nearly optimal since they essentially match known upper bounds from Klivans et al.

Specifically, all prior works rely on some subset of the following assumptions: (i) uniformly-bounded gradient norms, (ii) uniformly-bounded stochastic gradient variance (or even noise support), (iii) conditional independence between the step size and stochastic gradient. In this work, we show that AdaGrad-Norm exhibits an order optimal convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{poly}\\log(T)}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)$ after $T$ iterations under the same assumptions as optimally-tuned non adaptive SGD (unbounded gradient norms and affine noise variance scaling), and crucially, without needing any tuning parameters. We thus establish that adaptive gradient methods exhibit order-optimal convergence in much broader regimes than previously understood."

In this paper, we aim to identify families of hypergraphs that can be learned without suffering from a query complexity that grows exponentially in the size of the edges. We show that hypermatchings and low-degree near-uniform hypergraphs with n vertices are learnable with poly(n) queries. For learning hypermatchings (hypergraphs of maximum degree Delta = 1), we give an O(log^3 n)-round algorithm with O(n log^5 n) queries. We complement this upper bound by showing that there are no algorithms with poly(n) queries that learn hypermatchings in o(log log n) adaptive rounds. For hypergraphs with maximum degree Delta and edge size ratio rho, we give a non-adaptive algorithm with O((2n)^{rho Delta+1} log^2 n) queries.

In this paper, we show that for regression, benign overfitting is â€œbiasedâ€� towards certain types of problems, in the sense that its existence on one learning problem precludes its existence on other learning problems. On the negative side, we use this to argue that one should not expect benign overfitting to occur in general, for several natural extensions of the plain linear regression problems studied so far. We then turn to classification problems, and show that the situation there is much more favorable. Specifically, we consider a model where an arbitrary input distribution of some fixed dimension k is concatenated with a high-dimensional distribution, and prove that the max-margin predictor (to which gradient-based methods are known to converge in direction) is asymptotically biased towards minimizing the expected \\emph{squared hinge loss} w.r.t. the k-dimensional distribution. This allows us to reduce the question of benign overfitting in classification to the simpler question of whether this loss is a good surrogate for the misclassification error, and use it to show benign overfitting in some new settings."

      "abstract": "We study universal consistency of non-i.i.d. processes in the context of online learning. A stochastic process is said to admit universal consistency if there exists a learner that achieves vanishing average loss for any measurable response function on this process. When the loss function is unbounded, [1] showed that the only processes admitting strong universal consistency are those taking a finite number of values almost surely. However, when the loss function is bounded, the class of processes admitting strong universal consistency is much richer and its characterization could be dependent on the response setting [2]. In this paper, we show that this class of processes is independent from the response setting thereby closing an open question of [3] (Open Problem 3). Specifically, we show that the class of processes that admit universal online learning is the same for binary classification as for multiclass classification with countable number of classes. Consequently, any output setting with bounded loss can be reduced to binary classification. Our reduction is constructive and practical. Indeed, we show that the nearest neighbor algorithm is transported by our construction. For binary classification on a process admitting strong universal learning, we prove that nearest neighbor successfully learns at least all finite unions of intervals."

We show that acceleration remains unachievable for any deterministic algorithm which receives exact gradient and function-value information (unbounded queries, no noise). Our results hold for a large class of Hadamard manifolds including hyperbolic spaces and the symmetric space $\\mathrm{SL}(n) / \\mathrm{SO}(n)$ of positive definite $n \\times n$ matrices of determinant one. This cements a surprising gap between the complexity of convex optimization and geodesically convex optimization: for hyperbolic spaces, Riemannian gradient descent is optimal on the class of smooth and strongly geodesically convex functions (in the regime where the condition number scales with the radius of the optimization domain). The key idea for proving the lower bound consists of perturbing squared distance functions with sums of bump functions chosen by a resisting oracle."

That is, given samples from an unknown distribution $p$ over $\\{1, â€¦, n\\}$, is it $\\varepsilon_1$-close to or $\\varepsilon_2$-far from a reference distribution $q$ (in total variation distance)? Despite significant interest over the past decade, this problem is well understood only in the extreme cases. In the noiseless setting (i.e., $\\varepsilon_1 = 0$) the sample complexity is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, strongly sublinear in the domain size. At the other end of the spectrum, when $\\varepsilon_1 = \\varepsilon_2/2$, the sample complexity jumps to the barely sublinear $\\Theta(n/\\log n)$. However, very little is known about the intermediate regime. We fully characterize the price of tolerance in distribution testing as a function of $n$, $\\varepsilon_1$, $\\varepsilon_2$, up to a single $\\log n$ factor. Specifically, we show the sample complexity to be \\[\\tilde \\Theta\\mleft(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\ve_2^{2}} + \\frac{n}{\\log n} \\cdot \\max \\mleft\\{\\frac{\\ve_1}{\\ve_2^2},\\mleft(\\frac{\\ve_1}{\\ve_2^2}\\mright)^{\\!\\!2}\\mright\\}\\mright),\\]{providing} a smooth tradeoff between the two previously known cases. We also provide a similar characterization for the problem of tolerant equivalence testing, where both $p$ and $q$ are unknown. Surprisingly, in both cases, the main quantity dictating the sample complexity is the ratio $\\varepsilon_1/\\varepsilon_2^2$, and not the more intuitive $\\varepsilon_1/\\varepsilon_2$. Of particular technical interest is our lower bound framework, which involves novel approximation-theoretic tools required to handle the asymmetry between $\\varepsilon_1$ and $\\varepsilon_2$, a challenge absent from previous works."

Our algorithm succeeds for families of distributions that satisfy two well-studied properties in prior works on robust estimation: certifiable subgaussianity of directional moments and certifiable hypercontractivity of degree 2 polynomials. Our recovery guarantees hold in the â€œright affine-invariant normsâ€�: Mahalanobis distance for mean, multiplicative spectral and relative Frobenius distance guarantees for covariance and injective norms for higher moments. Prior works obtained private robust algorithms for mean estimation of subgaussian distributions with bounded covariance. For covariance estimation, ours is the first efficient algorithm (even in the absence of outliers) that succeeds without any condition-number assumptions. Our algorithms arise from a new framework that provides a general blueprint for modifying convex relaxations for robust estimation to satisfy strong worst-case stability guarantees in the appropriate parameter norms whenever the algorithms produce witnesses of correctness in their run. We verify such guarantees for a modification of standard sum-of-squares (SoS) semidefinite programming relaxations for robust estimation. Our privacy guarantees are obtained by combining stability guarantees with a new â€œestimate dependentâ€� noise injection mechanism in which noise scales with the eigenvalues of the estimated covariance. We believe this framework will be useful more generally in obtaining DP counterparts of robust estimators. Independently of our work, Ashtiani and Liaw [AL21] also obtained a polynomial time and sample private robust estimation algorithm for Gaussian distributions."

The FPE can be regarded as a continuity equation where the change of the density is completely determined by a time varying velocity field. Importantly, this velocity field also depends on the current density function. As a result, the ground-truth velocity field can be shown to be the solution of a fixed-point equation, a property that we call self-consistency. In this paper, we exploit this concept to design a potential function of the hypothesis velocity fields, and prove that, if such a function diminishes to zero during the training procedure, the trajectory of the densities generated by the hypothesis velocity fields converges to the solution of the FPE in the Wasserstein-2 sense. The proposed potential function is amenable to neural-network based parameterization as the stochastic gradient with respect to the parameter can be efficiently computed. Once a parameterized model, such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equation is trained, we can generate the entire trajectory to the FPE."

      "abstract": "The amount of training-data is one of the key factors which determines the generalization capacity of learning algorithms. Intuitively, one expects the error rate to decrease as the amount of training-data increases. Perhaps surprisingly, natural attempts to formalize this intuition give rise to interesting and challenging mathematical questions. For example, in their classical book on pattern recognition, Devroye, Gyorfi and Lugosi (1996) ask whether there exists a {monotone} Bayes-consistent algorithm.This question remained open for over 25 years, until recently Pestov (2021) resolved it for binary classification, using an intricate construction of a monotone Bayes-consistent algorithm. We derive a general result in multiclass classification, showing that every learning algorithm $A$ can be transformed to a monotone one with similar performance. Further, the transformation is efficient and only uses a black-box oracle access to $A$. This demonstrates that one can provably avoid non-monotonic behaviour without compromising performance, thus answering questions asked by Devroye, Gyorfi, and Lugosi (1996), Viering, Mey, and Loog (2019), Viering and Loog (2021), and by Mhammedi (2021). Our general transformation readily implies monotone learners in a variety of contexts: for example, Pestovâ€™s result follows by applying it on \\emph{any} Bayes-consistent algorithm (e.g., $k$-Nearest-Neighbours). In fact, our transformation extends Pestovâ€™s result to classification tasks with an arbitrary number of labels. This is contrast with Pestovâ€™s work which is tailored to binary classification. In addition, we provide uniform bounds on the error of the monotone algorithm. This makes our transformation applicable in distribution-free settings. For example, in PAC learning it implies that every learnable class admits a monotone PAC learner. This resolves questions asked by Viering, Mey, and Loog (2019); Viering and Loog (2021); Mhammedi (2021)"

We first consider the common paradigm of algorithms that switch between the decisions of the advice and a competitive algorithm, showing that no algorithm in this class can improve upon 3-consistency while staying robust.

We consider a wide range of settings, including stochastic and adversarial environments under full information or bandit feedback, and propose a policy optimization algorithm for each setting that makes use of novel correction terms and/or variants of dilated bonuses (Luo et al., 2021). For most settings, our algorithm is shown to achieve a near-optimal regret bound. One key technical contribution of this work is a new approximation scheme to tackle SSP problems that we call stacked discounted approximation and use in all our proposed algorithms. Unlike the finite-horizon approximation that is heavily used in recent SSP algorithms, our new approximation enables us to learn a near-stationary policy with only logarithmic changes during an episode and could lead to an exponential improvement in space complexity."

We are interested in characterizing processes for which learning is possible and whether there exist learning rules guaranteed to be universally consistent given the only assumption that such learning is possible. The case of unbounded losses is very restrictive since the learnable processes almost surely have to visit a finite number of points and as a result, simple memorization is optimistically universal. We focus on the bounded setting and give a complete characterization of the processes admitting strong and weak universal learning. We further show that the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (kNN) is not optimistically universal and present a novel variant of 1NN which is optimistically universal for general input and value spaces in both strong and weak settings.

      "abstract": "We study the problem of differentially private linear regression where each of the data point is sampled from a fixed sub-Gaussian style distribution. We propose and analyze a one-pass mini-batch stochastic gradient descent method (DP-AMBSSGD) where points in each iteration are sampled without replacement. Noise is added for DP but the noise standard deviation is estimated online. Compared to existing $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP techniques which have sub-optimal error bounds, DP-AMBSSGD is able to provide nearly optimal error bounds in terms of key parameters like dimensionality $d$, number of points $N$, and the standard deviation \\sigma of the noise in observations. For example, when the $d$-dimensional covariates are sampled i.i.d. from the normal distribution, then the excess error of DP-AMBSSGD due to privacy is $\\sigma^2 d/N(1+d/(\\epsilon^2 N))$, i.e., the error is meaningful when number of samples N\\geq d \\log d which is the standard operative regime for linear regression. In contrast, error bounds for existing efficient methods in this setting are: $d^3/(\\epsilon^2 N^2)$, even for $\\sigma=0$. That is, for constant $\\epsilon$, the existing techniques require $N=d^{1.5}$ to provide a non-trivial result."

      "abstract": "We introduce a universal framework for characterizing the statistical efficiency of a statistical estimation problem with differential privacy guarantees. Our framework, which we call High-dimensional Propose-Test-Release (HPTR), builds upon three crucial components: the exponential mechanism, robust statistics, and the Propose-Test-Release mechanism. Connecting all these together is the concept of resilience, which is central to robust statistical estimation. Resilience guides the design of the algorithm, the sensitivity analysis, and the success probability analysis of the test step in Propose-Test-Release. The key insight is that if we design an exponential mechanism that accesses the data only via one-dimensional and robust statistics, then the resulting local sensitivity can be dramatically reduced. Using resilience, we can provide tight local sensitivity bounds. These tight bounds readily translate into near-optimal utility guarantees in several cases. We give a general recipe for applying HPTR to a given instance of a statistical estimation problem and demonstrate it on canonical problems of mean estimation, linear regression, covariance estimation, and principal component analysis. We introduce a general utility analysis technique that proves that HPTR achieves near-optimal sample complexity under several scenarios studied in the literature."

      "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning which gives rise to a rich class of computationally-challenging inference tasks. In this work, we focus on the canonical task of clustering d-dimensional Gaussian mixtures with unknown (and possibly degenerate) covariance. Recent works (Ghosh et al. â€™20; Mao, Wein â€™21; Davis, Diaz, Wang â€™21) have established lower bounds against the class of low-degree polynomial methods and the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy for recovering certain hidden structures planted in Gaussian clustering instances. Prior work on many similar inference tasks portends that such lower bounds strongly suggest the presence of an inherent statistical-to-computational gap for clustering, that is, a parameter regime where the clustering task is statistically possible but no polynomial-time algorithm succeeds. One special case of the clustering task we consider is equivalent to the problem of finding a planted hypercube vector in an otherwise random subspace. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, this particular clustering model does not exhibit a statistical-to-computational gap, even though the aforementioned low-degree and SoS lower bounds continue to apply in this case. To achieve this, we give a polynomial-time algorithm based on the Lenstraâ€“Lenstraâ€“Lovasz lattice basis reduction method which achieves the statistically-optimal sample complexity of d+1 samples. This result extends the class of problems whose conjectured statistical-to-computational gaps can be \"closed\" by \"brittle\" polynomial-time algorithms, highlighting the crucial but subtle role of noise in the onset of statistical-to-computational gaps."

In light of previous depth separation theorems, which imply that a similar result cannot hold when the roles of width and depth are interchanged, it follows that depth plays a more significant role than width in the expressive power of neural networks. We extend our results to constructing networks with bounded weights, and to constructing networks with width at most $d+2$, which is close to the minimal possible width due to previous lower bounds. Both of these constructions cause an extra polynomial factor in the number of parameters over the target network. We also show an exact representation of wide and shallow networks using deep and narrow networks which, in certain cases, does not increase the number of parameters over the target network."

This empirical success has motivated a growing body of theoretical work proposing necessary and sufficient conditions under which efficient reinforcement learning is possible. From this line of work, a remarkably simple minimal sufficient condition has emerged for sample efficient reinforcement learning: MDPs with optimal value function V* and Q* linear in some known low-dimensional features. In this setting, recent works have designed sample efficient algorithms which require a number of samples polynomial in the feature dimension and independent of the size of state space. They however leave finding computationally efficient algorithms as future work and this is considered a major open problem in the community. In this work, we make progress on this open problem by presenting the first computational lower bound for RL with linear function approximation: unless NP=RP, no randomized polynomial time algorithm exists for deterministic transition MDPs with a constant number of actions and linear optimal value functions. To prove this, we show a reduction from Unique-Sat, where we convert a CNF formula into an MDP with deterministic transitions, constant number of actions and low dimensional linear optimal value functions. This result also exhibits the first computational-statistical gap in reinforcement learning with linear function approximation, as the underlying statistical problem is information-theoretically solvable with a polynomial number of queries, but no computationally efficient algorithm exists unless NP=RP. Finally, we also prove a quasi-polynomial time lower bound under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis."

Without sparsity assumptions, it has been established that interactivity cannot improve the minimax rates of estimation under these information constraints. The question of whether interactivity helps with natural inference tasks has been a topic of active research. We settle this question in the affirmative for the prototypical problems of high-dimensional sparse mean estimation and compressive sensing, by demonstrating a gap between interactive and noninteractive protocols. We further establish that the gap increases when we have more structured sparsity: for \\emph{block sparsity} this gap can be as large as \\emph{polynomial} in the dimensionality. Thus, the more structured the sparsity is, the greater is the advantage of interaction. Proving the lower bounds requires a careful breaking of a sum of correlated random variables into independent components using Baranyaiâ€™s theorem on decomposition of hypergraphs, which might be of independent interest."

In stochastic settings, some existing BOBW algorithms achieve tight gap-dependent regret bounds of $O(\\sum_{i: \\Delta_i>0} \\frac{\\log T}{\\Delta_i})$ for suboptimality gap $\\Delta_i$ of arm $i$ and time horizon $T$. On the other hand, it is shown in Audibert et al. (2007) that the regret bound can be tightened to $O(\\sum_{i: \\Delta_i>0} (\\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{\\Delta_i} + 1) \\log T )$ using the loss variance $\\sigma_i^2$ of each arm $i$ in the stochastic environments. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on the follow-the-regularized-leader method, which employs adaptive learning rates that depend on the empirical prediction error of the loss. This is the first BOBW algorithm with gap-variance-dependent bounds, showing that the variance information can be used even in the possibly adversarial environment. Further, the leading constant factor in our gap-variance dependent bound is only (almost) twice the value for the lower bound. In addition, the proposed algorithm enjoys multiple data-dependent regret bounds in adversarial settings and works well in stochastic settings with adversarial corruptions. Table 1 summarizes the achievable bounds in comparison with UCB-V Audibert et al. (2007), Tsallis-INF (Zimmert and Seldin, 2021) and LB-INF (Ito, 2021)."

In practice however, the number of arms can be very large resulting in large memory requirements for simultaneously processing them. In this paper we consider a streaming setting where the arms are presented in a stream and the algorithm uses limited memory to process these arms. Here, the goal is not only to minimize regret, but also to do so in minimal memory. Previous algorithms for this problem operate in one of the two settings: they either use $\\Omega(\\log \\log T)$ passes over the stream \\citep{rathod2021reducing, ChaudhuriKa20, Liau+18}, or just a single pass \\citep{Maiti+21}. In this paper we study the trade-off between memory and regret when $B$ passes over the stream are allowed, for any $B \\geq 1$, and establish \\emph{tight} regret upper and lower bounds for any $B$-pass algorithm. Our results uncover a surprising \\emph{sharp transition phenomenon}: $O(1)$ memory is sufficient to achieve $\\widetilde\\Theta\\paren{T^{\\half + \\frac{1}{2^{B+2}-2}}}$ regret in $B$ passes, and increasing the memory to any quantity that is $o(K)$ has almost no impact on further reducing this regret, unless we use $\\Omega(K)$ memory.

We develop an efficient algorithm that is able to adapt to the curvature on the fly.

Our approach is inspired by the framework of Bartlett et al. (2007) who studied a similar heterogeneous setting but with stronger gradient feedback.

An arc from $u$ to $v$ is generated with probability $p_u$ if $u$ and $v$ are in the same community and with probability $q_u$ otherwise. Given a graph generated from this model, the goal is to retrieve the communities. The DHSBM allows to generate graphs with planted communities while allowing heterogeneous degree distributions, a quite important feature of real-world networks. In the case where there are two communities, we present an iterative greedy linear-time algorithm that recovers them whenever $\\min_u \\frac{p_u - q_u}{\\sqrt{p_u}} = \\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log (n)/n})$. We also show that, up to a constant, this condition is necessary. Our results also extend to the standard (undirected) SBM, where $p_u = p$ and $q_u= q$ for all nodes $u$.

While the former model is often both computationally and statistically tractable, the latter requires no distributional assumptions. In an attempt to achieve the best of both worlds, previous work proposed the smooth online setting where each sample is drawn from an adversarially chosen distribution, which is smooth, i.e., it has a bounded density with respect to a fixed dominating measure. Existing results for the smooth setting were known only for binary-valued function classes and were computation- ally expensive in general; in this paper, we fill these lacunae. In particular, we provide tight bounds on the minimax regret of learning a nonparametric function class, with nearly optimal dependence on both the horizon and smoothness parameters. Furthermore, we provide the first oracle-efficient, no-regret algorithms in this setting. In particular, we propose an oracle-efficient improper algorithm whose regret achieves optimal dependence on the horizon and a proper algorithm requiring only a single oracle call per round whose regret has the optimal horizon dependence in the classification setting and is sublinear in general. Both algorithms have exponentially worse dependence on the smoothness parameter of the adversary than the minimax rate. We then prove a lower bound on the oracle complexity of any proper learning algorithm, which matches the oracle-efficient upper bounds up to a polynomial factor, thus demonstrating the existence of a statistical-computational gap in smooth online learning. Finally, we apply our results to the contextual bandit setting to show that if a function class is learnable in the classical setting, then there is an oracle-efficient, no-regret algorithm for contextual bandits in the case that contexts arrive in a smooth manner."

For U bounded away from zero, or U a one-sided threshold function, it was shown by Talagrand (2000, 2011) that for small densities alpha, the free energy of the model converges in the large-N limit to the replica symmetric formula conjectured in the physics literature (Krauthâ€“Mezard 1989, see also Gardnerâ€“Derrida 1988). We give a new proof of this result, which covers the more general class of all functions U that are bounded above and satisfy a certain variance bound. The proof uses the (first and second) moment method conditional on the approximate message passing iterates of the model. In order to deduce our main theorem, we also prove a new concentration result for the perceptron model in the case where U is not bounded away from zero."

However, while this rate is tight in the worst case, it remained open whether faster rates are possible, without prior knowledge, if few changes in distribution are actually \\emph{severe}. To resolve this question, we propose a new notion of \\emph{significant shift}, which only counts very severe changes that clearly necessitate a restart: roughly, these are changes involving not only best arm switches, but also involving large aggregate differences in reward overtime. Thus, our resulting procedure adaptively achieves rates always faster (sometimes significantly) than $O(\\sqrt{ST})$, where $S\\ll L$ only counts best arm switches, while at the same time, always faster than the optimal $O(V^{\\frac{1}{3}}T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ when expressed in terms of \\emph{total variation} $V$ (which aggregates differences overtime).

(b) In contrast, for multi-channel inputs, multiple output channels can be necessary to merely realize all matrix-valued linear functions and thus the inductive bias \\emph{does} depend on $C$. However, for sufficiently large $C$, the induced regularizer is again given by an SDP that is independent of $C$. In particular, the induced regularizer for $K=1$ and $K=D$ (input dimension) are given in closed form as the nuclear norm and the $\\ell_{2,1}$ group-sparse norm, respectively, of the Fourier coefficients of the linear predictor.

We show that the unique non-trivial stationary point of the population log-likelihood is its global maximum, and establish that the expectation-maximization algorithm is guaranteed to converge to it in the single latent variable case. Our results for the landscape of the log-likelihood function in general latent tree models provide support for the extensive practical use of maximum likelihood based-methods in this setting. Our results for the expectation-maximization algorithm extend an emerging line of work on obtaining global convergence guarantees for this celebrated algorithm. We show our results for the non-trivial stationary points of the log-likelihood by arguing that a certain system of polynomial equations obtained from the EM updates has a unique non-trivial solution. The global convergence of the EM algorithm follows by arguing that all trivial fixed points are higher-order saddle points."

To better understand this empirical observation, we consider the generalization error of two-layer neural networks trained to interpolation by gradient descent on the logistic loss following random initialization. We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional log-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training labels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error, perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax optimal test error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that require linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting where both the model and learning dynamics are fundamentally nonlinear."

The learner has access to a family of weight functions such that the test distribution is a reweighting of the training distribution under one of these functions, a setting typically studied under the name of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). We consider the problem of deriving regret bounds in the classical learning theory setting, and require that the resulting regret bounds hold uniformly for all potential test distributions. We show that the DRO formulation does not guarantee uniformly small regret under distribution shift. We instead propose an alternative method called Minimax Regret Optimization (MRO), and show that under suitable conditions, this method achieves uniformly low regret across all test distributions. We also adapt our technique to have strong guarantees when the test distributions are heterogeneous in their similarity to the training data. Given the widespead optimization of worst case risks in current approaches to robust machine learning, we believe that MRO can be an attractive framework to address a broad range of distribution shift scenarios."

Despite the recent efforts on relaxing these assumptions, existing works are only able to relax one of the two factors, leaving the strong assumption on the other factor intact. As an important open problem, can we achieve sample-efficient offline RL with weak assumptions on both factors? In this paper we answer the question in the positive. We analyze a simple algorithm based on the primal-dual formulation of MDPs, where the dual variables (discounted occupancy) are modeled using a density-ratio function against offline data. With proper regularization, the algorithm enjoys polynomial sample complexity, under only realizability and single-policy concentrability. We also provide alternative analyses based on different assumptions to shed light on the nature of primal-dual algorithms for offline RL."

In this linear regime, computationally and statistically efficient methods exist where the potentially infinite state and action spaces can be captured through a known feature embedding, with the sample complexity scaling with the (intrinsic) dimension of these features. When the action space is finite, significantly more sophisticated results allow non-linear function approximation under appropriate structural constraints on the underlying RL problem, permitting for instance, the learning of good features instead of assuming access to them. In this work, we present the first result for non-linear function approximation which holds for general action spaces under a linear embeddability condition, which generalizes all linear and finite action settings. We design a novel optimistic posterior sampling strategy, TS$^3$ for such problems. We further show worst case sample complexity guarantees that scale with a rank parameter of the RL problem, the linear embedding dimension introduced here and standard measures of function class complexity."

We show, for the first time, that the almost sure convergence rates obtained for these stochastic gradient methods on strongly convex functions, are arbitrarily close to their optimal convergence rates possible. For non-convex objective functions, we not only show that a weighted average of the squared gradient norms converges to zero almost surely, but also the last iterates of the algorithms.

With variants ranging from classical settings like PAC learning and regression to recent trends such as adversarially robust and private learning, itâ€™s surprising we still lack a unified theory; traditional proofs of the equivalence tend to be disparate, and rely on strong model-specific assumptions like uniform convergence and sample compression. In this work, we give the first model-independent framework explaining the equivalence of realizable and agnostic learnability: a three-line blackbox reduction that simplifies, unifies, and extends our understanding across a wide variety of settings. This includes models with no known characterization of learnability such as learning with arbitrary distributional assumptions or general loss, as well as a host of other popular settings such as robust learning, partial learning, fair learning, and the statistical query model. More generally, we argue that the equivalence of realizable and agnostic learning is actually a special case of a broader phenomenon we call property generalization: any desirable property of a learning algorithm (e.g. noise tolerance, privacy, stability) that can be satisfied over finite hypothesis classes extends (possibly in some variation) to any learnable hypothesis class."

We ask whether it is possible to obtain optimal instance-dependent regret $\\wt{O}(1/\\Delta)$ where $\\Delta$ is the gap between the $m$-th and $m+1$-st best arms. Such guarantees were recently achieved by \\cite{pacchiano2021instance, huang2021towards} in a model in which the players are able to implicitly communicate through intentional collisions.

We show that the collisions tester achieves a sharp maximal constant in the number of standard deviations of separation between uniform and non-uniform inputs.

This stringent notionâ€”that predictions be well-calibrated across a rich class of intersecting subpopulationsâ€”provides its strong guarantees at a cost: the computational and sample complexity of learning multicalibrated predictors are high, and grow exponentially with the number of class labels. In contrast, the relaxed notion of multiaccuracy can be achieved more efficiently, yet many of the most desirable properties of multicalibration cannot be guaranteed assuming multiaccuracy alone. This tension raises a key question: \\emph{Can we learn predictors with multicalibration-style guarantees at a cost commensurate with multiaccuracy?} In this work, we define and initiate the study of \\emph{Low-Degree Multicalibration}. Low-Degree Multicalibration defines a hierarchy of increasingly-powerful multi-group fairness notions that spans multiaccuracy and the original formulation of multicalibration at the extremes. Our main technical contribution demonstrates that key properties of multicalibration, related to fairness and accuracy, actually manifest as low-degree properties. Importantly, we show that low-degree multicalibration can be significantly more efficient than full multicalibration. In the multi-class setting, the sample complexity to achieve low-degree multicalibration improves exponentially (in the number of classes) over full multicalibration. Our work presents compelling evidence that low-degree multicalibration represents a sweet spot, pairing computational and sample efficiency with strong fairness and accuracy guarantees."

Previous works have established that $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ frequentist regret is optimal for the adaptive control of LQRs. However, the existing methods either work only in restrictive settings, require a priori known stabilizing controllers or utilize computationally intractable approaches.

TSAC does not require a priori known stabilizing controller and achieves fast stabilization of the underlying system by effectively exploring the environment in the early stages. Our result hinges on developing a novel lower bound on the probability that the TS provides an optimistic sample. By carefully prescribing an early exploration strategy and a policy update rule, we show that TS achieves order-optimal regret in adaptive control of multidimensional stabilizable LQRs.

Using this reduction we obtain a (nearly) optimal algorithm for smooth optimization with convergence rate $\\tilde{O}(1/T^2)$ and uniform stability $O(T^2/n)$, resolving an open problem of Chen et al. (2018); Attia and Koren (2021). For more general geometries, we develop a variant of Mirror Descent for smooth optimization with convergence rate $\\tilde{O}(1/T)$ and uniform stability $O(T/n)$, leaving open the question of devising a general conversion method as in the Euclidean case."

More precisely, we give nonasymptotic expected $l^2$-distance bounds between the LSE and the true regression function, where expectation is evaluated on a fresh, counterfactual, trajectory. We leverage recently developed information-theoretic methods to establish the optimality of the LSE for nonparametric hypotheses classes in terms of supremum norm metric entropy and a subgaussian parameter. Next, we relate this subgaussian parameter to the stability of the underlying process using notions from dynamical systems theory. When combined, these developments lead to rate-optimal error bounds that scale as $T^{-1/(2+q)}$ for suitably stable processes and hypothesis classes with metric entropy growth of order $\\delta^{-q}$. Here, $T$ is the length of the observed trajectory, $\\delta \\in \\mathbb{R}_+$ is the packing granularity and $q\\in (0,2)$ is a complexity term. Finally, we specialize our results to a number of scenarios of practical interest, such as Lipschitz dynamics, generalized linear models, and dynamics described by functions in certain classes of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)."

The ability of such methods to generalize well has been attributed to their implicit bias towards large margin predictors, both asymptotically as well as in finite time. We give an additional unified explanation for this generalization and relate it to two simple properties of the optimization objective, that we refer to as realizability and self-boundedness. We introduce a general setting of unconstrained stochastic convex optimization with these properties, and analyze generalization of gradient methods through the lens of algorithmic stability. In this broader setting, we obtain sharp stability bounds for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent which apply even for a very large number of gradient steps, and use them to derive general generalization bounds for these algorithms. Finally, as direct applications of the general bounds, we return to the setting of linear classification with separable data and establish several novel test loss and test accuracy bounds for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent for a variety of loss functions with different tail decay rates. In some of these cases, our bounds significantly improve upon the existing generalization error bounds in the literature."

We study the inference task of learning these types by queries on subsets, or pools, of the items that only reveal a form of coarsened information on the features - in our case, the sum of all the features in the pool. This is a realistic scenario in situations where one has memory or technical constraints in the data collection process, or where the data is subject to anonymisation. Related prominent problems are the quantitative group testing problem, of which it is a generalisation, as well as the compressed sensing problem, of which it is a special case. In the present article, we are interested in the minimum number of queries needed to efficiently infer the features, in the setting where the feature vector is chosen uniformly while fixing the frequencies, and one of the features, say $0$, is dominant in the sense that the number $k = n^{\\theta}, \\theta \\in (0,1)$, of non-zero features among the items is much smaller than $n$. It is known that in this case, all features can be recovered in exponential time using no more than $O(k)$ queries. However, so far, all \\emph{efficient} inference algorithms required at least $\\Omega(k\\ln n)$ queries, and it was unknown whether this gap is artificial or of a fundamental nature. Here we show that indeed, the previous gap between the information-theoretic and computational bounds is not inherent to the problem by providing an efficient algorithm that succeeds with high probability and employs no more than $O(k)$ measurements. This also solves a prominent open question for the quantitative group testing problem."

Specifically, given a random permutation $\\pi^*$ on $[n]$ and $n$ iid pairs of correlated Gaussian vectors $\\{X_{\\pi^*(i)}, Y_i\\}$ in $\\reals^d$ with noise parameter $\\sigma$, the edge weights are given by $A_{ij}=\\kappa(X_i,X_j)$ and $B_{ij}=\\kappa(Y_i,Y_j)$ for some link function $\\kappa$.

      "abstract": "We consider the offline reinforcement learning problem, where the aim is to learn a decision making policy from logged data. Offline RLâ€”particularly when coupled with (value) function approximation to allow for generalization in large or continuous state spacesâ€”is becoming increasingly relevant in practice, because it avoids costly and time-consuming online data collection and is well suited to safety-critical domains. Existing sample complexity guarantees for offline value function approximation methods typically require both (1) distributional assumptions (i.e., good coverage) and (2) representational assumptions (i.e., ability to represent some or all $Q$-value functions) stronger than what is required for supervised learning. However, the necessity of these conditions and the fundamental limits of offline RL are not well understood in spite of decades of research. This led Chen and Jiang (2019) to conjecture that concentrability (the most standard notion of coverage) and realizability (the weakest representation condition) alone are not sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL. We resolve this conjecture in the positive by proving that in general, even if both concentrability and realizability are satisfied, any algorithm requires sample complexity either polynomial in the size of the state space or exponential in other parameters to learn a non-trivial policy. Our results show that sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning requires either restrictive coverage conditions or representation conditions that go beyond supervised learning, and highlight a phenomenon called over-coverage which serves as a fundamental barrier for offline value function approximation methods. A consequence of our results for reinforcement learning with linear function approximation is that the separation between online and offline RL can be arbitrarily large, even in constant dimension."

Compared to their Euclidean counterparts, Riemannian iterative algorithms are much less understood due to the lack of a global linear structure on the manifold. We overcome this difficulty by introducing an extended Fermi coordinate frame which allows us to map the asymptotic behavior of the proposed Riemannian Robbinsâ€“Monro (RRM) class of algorithms to that of an associated deterministic dynamical system under very mild assumptions on the underlying manifold. In so doing, we provide a general template of almost sure convergence results that mirrors and extends the existing theory for Euclidean Robbins-Monro schemes, albeit with a significantly more involved analysis that requires a number of new geometric ingredients. We showcase the flexibility of the proposed RRM framework by using it to establish the convergence of a retraction-based analogue of the popular optimistic / extra-gradient methods for solving minimization problems and games, and we provide a unified treatment for their convergence."

In this work, we generalize this result beyond the standard choice of Shannonâ€™s mutual information to measure the dependence between the input and the output. Our main result shows that it is indeed possible to replace the mutual information by any strongly convex function of the joint input-output distribution, with the subgaussianity condition on the losses replaced by a bound on an appropriately chosen norm capturing the geometry of the dependence measure. This allows us to derive a range of generalization bounds that are either entirely new or strengthen previously known ones. Examples include bounds stated in terms of p-norm divergences and the Wasserstein-2 distance, which are respectively applicable for heavy-tailed loss distributions and highly smooth loss functions. Our analysis is entirely based on elementary tools from convex analysis by tracking the growth of a potential function associated with the dependence measure and the loss function."

To quantify our approximation guarantees, we refine the definition of weak submodularity by Das and Kempe (2011) and introduce the notion of an upper submodularity ratio, which we connect to the minimum k-sparse eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. More generally, we look at the problem of maximizing a set function f with lower and upper submodularity ratio $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ under a matroid constraint. For this problem, our algorithms have asymptotic approximation guarantee 1/2 and (1 - 1/e) as the function is closer to being submodular.

Despite its wide usage in image segmentation and related problems, its consistency has remained open. We resolve this open question, showing that the Lovász hinge is inconsistent for its desired target unless the set function is modular. Leveraging a recent embedding framework, we instead derive the target loss for which the Lovász hinge is consistent. This target, which we call the structured abstain problem, allows one to abstain on any subset of the k predictions. We derive two link functions, each of which are consistent for all submodular set functions simultaneously."

Prior to this work, comparable guarantees could only be achieved via sum-of-squares [Ma, Shi, Steurer 2016]. In contrast, fast algorithms [Hopkins, Schramm, Shi, Steurer 2016] could only decompose tensors of rank at most $$O(d^{4/3}/polylog(d))$$. Our algorithmic result rests on two key ingredients. A clean lifting of the third-order tensor to a sixth-order tensor, which can be expressed in the language of tensor networks. A careful decomposition of the tensor network into a sequence of rectangular matrix multiplications, which allows us to have a fast implementation of the algorithm."

      "abstract": "Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are a widely used probabilistic model for negatively correlated sets. DPPs are used in Machine Learning applications to select a diverse, yet representative subset of data. In these applications, the parameters of the DPP need to be fit to match the data; typically, we seek a set of parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data. The algorithms used for this task either optimize over a limited family of DPPs, or else use local improvement heuristics that do not provide theoretical guarantees of optimality. It is natural to ask if there exist efficient algorithms for finding a maximum likelihood DPP model for a given data set. In seminal work on DPPs in Machine Learning, Kulesza conjectured in his PhD Thesis (2012) that the problem is NP-complete. In this work we prove Kuleszaâ€™s conjecture: we prove moreover, that even computing a $1-\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{poly} \\log N}$-approximation to the maximum log-likelihood of a DPP on a set of $N$ items is NP-complete. At the same time, we also obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm obtaining a nontrivial worst-case approximation to the optimal likelihood: we present a polynomial-time $1/\\log m$-approximation algorithm (for data sets of size $m$), which moreover obtains a $1-\\frac{1}{\\log N}$-approximation if all $N$ elements appear in a $O(1/N)$-fraction of the subsets. In terms of techniques, the hardness result reduces to solving a gap instance of a â€œvector coloring\" problem on a hypergraph obtained from an adaptation of the constructions of Bogdanov, Obata and Trevisan (FOCS 2002), using the strong expanders of Alon and Capalbo (FOCS 2007)."

Prior results state that the statistical difficulty for both benchmarks scales polynomially with the system state dimension up to system-theoretic quantities. However, this does not reveal the whole picture. By utilizing minimax lower bounds for both benchmarks, we prove that there exist non-trivial classes of systems for which learning complexity scales dramatically, i.e. exponentially, with the system dimension. This situation arises in the case of underactuated systems, i.e. systems with fewer inputs than states. Such systems are structurally difficult to control and their system theoretic quantities can scale exponentially with the system dimension dominating learning complexity. Under some additional structural assumptions (bounding systems away from uncontrollability), we provide qualitatively matching upper bounds. We prove that learning complexity can be at most exponential with the controllability index of the system, that is the degree of underactuation."

In this paper, we show that there exists a family of design matrices lacking well-spreadness such that consistent recovery of the parameter vector in the above robust linear regression model is information-theoretically impossible. We further investigate the average-case time complexity of certifying well-spreadness of random matrices. We show that it is possible to efficiently certify whether a given $n$-by-$d$ Gaussian matrix is well-spread if the number of observations is quadratic in the ambient dimension. We complement this result by showing rigorous evidence â€”in the form of a lower bound against low-degree polynomialsâ€” of the computational hardness of this same certification problem when the number of observations is $o(d^2)$."

In particular, when $T$ tasks in $d$ dimensions are presented cyclically for $k$ iterations, we prove an upper bound of $T^2\\min\\{1/\\sqrt{k},d/k\\}$ on the forgetting.

In particular, we are interested in the following question: what is the maximal noise level $\\sigma^2$, for which the sample complexity is essentially the same as when estimating the centers from labeled measurements? To that end, we restrict attention to a Bayesian formulation of the problem, where the centers are uniformly distributed on the sphere $\\sqrt{d}\\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$. Our main results characterize the \\emph{exact noise threshold} $\\sigma^2$ below which the GMM learning problem, in the large system limit $d,k\\to\\infty$, is as easy as learning from labeled observations, and above which it is substantially harder. The threshold occurs at $\\frac{\\log k}{d} = \\frac12\\log\\left( 1+\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\right)$, which is the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Thinking of the set of $k$ centers as a code, this noise threshold can be interpreted as the largest noise level for which the error probability of the code over the AWGN channel is small. Previous works on the GMM learning problem have identified the \\emph{minimum distance} between the centers as a key parameter in determining the statistical difficulty of learning the corresponding GMM. While our results are only proved for GMMs whose centers are uniformly distributed over the sphere, they hint that perhaps it is the decoding error probability associated with the center constellation as a channel code that determines the statistical difficulty of learning the corresponding GMM, rather than just the minimum distance."

This allows us to re-derive the chaining mutual information bound from the literature, and to obtain novel chained information-theoretic generalisation bounds, based on the Wasserstein distance and other probability metrics. We show on some toy examples that the chained generalisation bound can be significantly tighter than its standard counterpart, particularly when the distribution of the hypotheses selected by the algorithm is very concentrated."

A number of papers have proposed randomized forecasting strategies that achieve an $\\epsilon$-calibration error rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$, which we prove is tight in general. On the other hand, it is well known that it is not possible to be calibrated without randomization, or if nature also sees the forecasterâ€™s randomization; in both cases the calibration error could be $\\Omega(1)$. Inspired by the equally seminal works on the power of two choices and imprecise probability theory, we study a small variant of the standard online calibration problem. The adversary gives the forecaster the option of making two nearby probabilistic forecasts, or equivalently an interval forecast of small width, and the endpoint closest to the revealed outcome is used to judge calibration. This power of two choices, or imprecise forecast, accords the forecaster with significant powerâ€”we show that a faster $\\epsilon$-calibration rate of $O(1/T)$ can be achieved even without deploying any randomization."

The goal of the learner is to output a hypothesis vector $\\wt{\\vec w}$ such that $F(\\wt{\\vec w}) = C \\, \\opt+\\eps$ with high probability, where $C$ is a universal constant. As our main contribution, we give efficient constant-factor approximate learners for a broad class of distributions (including log-concave distributions) and activation functions (including ReLUs and sigmoids). Concretely, for the class of isotropic log-concave distributions, we obtain the following important corollaries: \\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=3pc, rightmargin = 1.5pc] \\item For the logistic activation, i.e., $\\sigma(t) = 1/(1+e^{-t})$, we obtain the first polynomial-time constant factor approximation, even under the Gaussian distribution. Moreover, our algorithm has sample complexity $\\wt{O}(d/\\eps)$, which is tight within polylogarithmic factors. \\item For the ReLU activation, i.e., $\\sigma(t) = \\max(0,t)$, we give an efficient algorithm with sample complexity $\\wt{O}(d \\, \\polylog(1/\\eps))$. Prior to our work, the best known constant-factor approximate learner had sample complexity $\\Omega(d/\\eps)$. \\end{itemize} In both settings, our algorithms are simple, performing gradient-descent on the (regularized) $L_2^2$-loss. The correctness of our algorithms relies on novel structural results that we establish, showing that (essentially all) stationary points of the underlying non-convex loss are approximately optimal."

In this context, recent years have witnessed the development of various generalization bounds suggesting different complexity notions such as the mutual information between the data sample and the algorithm output, compressibility of the hypothesis space, and the fractal dimension of the hypothesis space. While these bounds have illuminated the problem at hand from different angles, their suggested complexity notions might appear seemingly unrelated, thereby restricting their high-level impact. In this study, we prove novel generalization bounds through the lens of rate-distortion theory, and explicitly relate the concepts of mutual information, compressibility, and fractal dimensions in a single mathematical framework. Our approach consists of (i) defining a generalized notion of compressibility by using source coding concepts, and (ii) showing that the â€™compression error rateâ€™ can be linked to the generalization error both in expectation and with high probability. We show that in the â€™lossless compressionâ€™ setting, we recover and improve existing mutual information-based bounds, whereas a â€™lossy compressionâ€™ scheme allows us to link generalization to the rate-distortion dimension - a particular notion of fractal dimension. Our results bring a more unified perspective on generalization and open up several future research directions."

In full generality, matching upper and lower bounds are known which show that this comes at the unavoidable cost of an additive GU^3, which is not needed when either G or U is known in advance. Surprisingly, recent results by Kempka et al. (2019) show that no such price for adaptivity is needed in the specific case of 1-Lipschitz losses like the hinge loss. We follow up on this observation by showing that there is in fact never a price to pay for adaptivity if we specialise to any of the other common supervised online learning losses: our results cover log loss, (linear and non-parametric) logistic regression, square loss prediction, and (linear and non-parametric) least-squares regression. We also fill in several gaps in the literature by providing matching lower bounds with an explicit dependence on U. In all cases we obtain scale-free algorithms, which are suitably invariant under rescaling of the data. Our general goal is to establish achievable rates without concern for computational efficiency, but for linear logistic regression we also provide an adaptive method that is as efficient as the recent non-adaptive algorithm by Agarwal et al.

In this work, we analyze when strong robustness guarantees can be achieved even in the face of such attacks. We define and show how to provide robustly-reliable predictions, in which the predicted label is guaranteed to be correct so long as the adversary has not exceeded a given corruption budget, even in the presence of instance targeted attacks, where the adversary aims to cause a failure on specific test examples. Our guarantees are substantially stronger than those in prior approaches, which were only able to provide certificates that the prediction of the learning algorithm does not change, as opposed to certifying that the prediction is correct, as we do here. Remarkably, we provide a complete characterization of learnability in this setting, in particular, nearly-tight matching upper and lower bounds on the region that can be certified, as well as efficient algorithms for computing this region given an ERM oracle. Moreover, for the case of linear separators over logconcave distributions, we provide efficient truly polynomial time algorithms (i.e., non-oracle algorithms) for such robustly-reliable predictions. We also extend these results to the active setting where the algorithm adaptively asks for labels of specific informative examples, and the difficulty is that the adversary might even be adaptive to this interaction, as well as to the agnostic learning setting where there is no perfect classifier even over the uncorrupted data."

In this paper we address the question of whether worst-case lower bounds for regret in online learning of Markov decision processes (MDPs) can be circumvented when information about the MDP, in the form of predictions about its optimal Q-value function, is given to the algorithm. We show that when the predictions about the optimal Q-value function satisfy a reasonably weak condition we call distillation, then we can improve regret bounds by replacing the set of state-action pairs with the set of state-action pairs on which the predictions are grossly inaccurate. This improvement holds for both uniform regret bounds and gap-based ones. Further, we are able to achieve this property with an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret when given arbitrary predictions (i.e., even those which are not a distillation). Our work extends a recent line of work on algorithms with predictions, which has typically focused on simple online problems such as caching and scheduling, to the more complex and general problem of reinforcement learning."

Motivated by the modern large-scale applications, we study the problem in the streaming model, in which the memory is heavily limited and only a single or very few passes over the input are allowed. Specifically, we investigate whether a good hierarchical clustering can be obtained, or at least whether we can approximately estimate the value of the optimal hierarchy. To measure the quality of a hierarchy, we use the HC minimization objective introduced by Dasgupta [STOCâ€™16]. Assuming that the input is an $n$-vertex weighted graph whose edges arrive in a stream, we derive the following results on space-vs-accuracy tradeoffs: â€“ With O(n polylog n) space, we develop a single-pass algorithm, whose approximation ratio matches the currently best offline algorithm by Charikar and Chatziafratis [SODAâ€™17]. â€“ When the space is more limited, namely, $n^{1-o(1)}$, we prove that no algorithm can even estimate the value of the optimum hierarchical tree to within an $o(log(n)/loglog(n))$ factor, even when allowed polylog(n) passes over the input and exponential time. â€“ In the most stringent setting of polylog{n} space, studied extensively in the literature, we rule out algorithms that can even distinguish between â€œhighlyâ€�-vs-â€œpoorlyâ€� clusterable graphs, namely, graphs that have an $n^{1/2-o(1)}$ factor gap between their HC objective value. â€“ Finally, we prove that any single-pass streaming algorithm that computes an optimal HC clustering requires storing almost the entire input even if allowed exponential time. Our algorithmic results establish a general structural result that proves that cut sparsifiers of input graphs can preserve the cost of â€œbalancedâ€� hierarchical trees to within some constant factor, and thus can be used in place of the original (dense) graphs when solving HC.

Our first set of results concerns the fundamental statistical limits.

For the Bernoulli design, we determine the precise number of tests required to solve the associated detection problem (where the goal is to distinguish between a group testing instance and pure noise), improving both the upper and lower bounds of Truong, Aldridge, and Scarlett (2020). For both group testing models, we also study the power of computationally efficient (polynomial-time) inference procedures. We determine the precise number of tests required for the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms to solve the detection problem.

However, for the main parametrization of interest â€”non-linear but regular networksâ€” no tight characterization has yet been achieved, despite significant developments. We take a step in this direction by considering depth-2 neural networks trained by SGD in the mean-field regime. We consider functions on binary inputs that depend on a latent low-dimensional subspace (i.e., small number of coordinates). This regime is of interest since it is poorly understood how neural networks routinely tackle high-dimensional datasets and adapt to latent low-dimensional structure without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Accordingly, we study SGD-learnability with $O(d)$ sample complexity in a large ambient dimension $d$. Our main results characterize a hierarchical property â€”the merged-staircase propertyâ€” that is both \\emph{necessary and nearly sufficient} for learning in this setting. We further show that non-linear training is necessary: for this class of functions, linear methods on any feature map (e.g., the NTK) are not capable of learning efficiently. The key tools are a new â€œdimension-freeâ€� dynamics approximation result that applies to functions defined on a latent space of low-dimension, a proof of global convergence based on polynomial identity testing, and an improvement of lower bounds against linear methods for non-almost orthogonal functions."

However, due to the highly complex nature of the problem, progress has been relatively slow. In this note, through the lens of infinite-width networks, a.k.a. neural kernels, we present one such principle resulting from hierarchical localities. It is well-known that the eigenstructure of infinite-width multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) depends solely on the concept {\\it frequency}, which measures the order of interactions. We show that the topologies from deep convolutional networks (CNNs) restructure the associated eigenspaces into finer subspaces. In addition to frequency, the new structure also depends on the concept {\\it space}, which measures the spatial distance among nonlinear interaction terms. The resulting fine-grained eigenstructure dramatically improves the networkâ€™s learnability, empowering them to simultaneously model a much richer class of interactions. including Long-Range-Low-Frequency interactions, Short-Range-High-Frequency interactions, and various interpolations and extrapolations in-between. Additionally, model scaling can improve the resolutions of interpolations and extrapolations and, therefore, the networkâ€™s learnability. Finally, we prove a sharp characterization of the generalization error for infinite-width CNNs (aka C-NTK and CNN-GP) of any depth in the high-dimensional setting. Two corollaries follow: (1) infinite-width deep CNNs can overcome the curse of dimensionality without losing their expressivity, and (2) scaling improves performance in both the finite and infinite data regimes."

Our general result implies the first polynomial time sampling algorithms for low-rank Ising models such as Hopfield networks with a fixed number of patterns and Bayesian clustering models with low-dimensional contexts, and greatly improves the polynomial time sampling regime for the antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic Ising model with inconsistent field on expander graphs. It also improves on previous approximation algorithm results based on the naive mean-field approximation in variational methods and statistical physics. Our approach is based on a new fusion of ideas from the MCMC and variational inference worlds. As part of our algorithm, we define a new nonconvex variational problem which allows us to sample from an exponential reweighting of a distribution by a negative definite quadratic form, and show how to make this procedure provably efficient using stochastic gradient descent. On top of this, we construct a new simulated tempering chain (on an extended state space arising from the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform) which overcomes the obstacle posed by large positive eigenvalues, and combine it with the SGD-based sampler to solve the full problem."

Bounds that apply in a narrow range of sample sizes are also known for linear regression.

The definitions of these adversaries specify the {\\sl type} of allowable corruptions (noise model) as well as {\\sl when} these corruptions can be made (adaptivity); the latter differentiates between oblivious adversaries that can only corrupt the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ and adaptive adversaries that can have their corruptions depend on the specific sample $S$ that is drawn from $\\mathcal{D}$. We investigate whether oblivious adversaries are effectively equivalent to adaptive adversaries, across all noise models studied in the literature, under a unifying framework that we introduce. Specifically, can the behavior of an algorithmÂ $\\mathcal{A}$ in the presence of oblivious adversaries always be well-approximated by that of an algorithm $\\mathcal{A}â€™$ in the presence of adaptive adversaries? Our first result shows that this is indeed the case for the broad class of {\\sl statistical query} algorithms, under all reasonable noise models.

Finally, we map out an approach towards proving this statement in its fullest generality, for all algorithms and under all reasonable noise models."

Learning from high-dimensional observations has been the subject of extensive investigation in supervised learning and statistics (e.g., via sparsity), but analogous issues in reinforcement learning are not well understood, even in finite state/action (tabular) domains. We introduce a new problem setting for reinforcement learning, the Exogenous Markov Decision Process (ExMDP), in which the state space admits an (unknown) factorization into a small controllable (or, endogenous) component and a large irrelevant (or, exogenous) component; the exogenous component is independent of the learnerâ€™s actions, but evolves in an arbitrary, temporally correlated fashion. We provide a new algorithm, OSSR, which learns a near-optimal policy with sample complexity polynomial in the size of the endogenous component and nearly independent of the size of the exogenous component, thereby offering a doubly-exponential improvement over off-the-shelf algorithms. Our results highlight for the first time that sample-efficient reinforcement learning is possible in the presence of exogenous information, and provide a simple, user-friendly benchmark for investigation going forward."

Adaptivity is a fundamental concept studied due to the need to parallelize computation and understand the speedups attainable. The query complexity of local search is tightly related to the complexity of computing stationary points of a function, thus bounds for local search can give insights into the performance of algorithms such as gradient descent. We focus on the $d$-dimensional grid $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n \\}^d$, where the dimension $d \\geq 2$ is a constant. Our main contribution is to give algorithms and lower bounds that characterize the trade-off between the number of rounds of adaptivity and the query complexity of local search, when the number of rounds is constant and polynomial in $n$, respectively. The local search analysis also enables us to characterize the query complexity of computing a Brouwer fixed point in rounds. Our proof technique for lower bounding the query complexity in rounds may be of independent interest as an alternative to the classical relational adversary method of Aaronson from the fully adaptive setting."

We identify a gap in the current theoretical understanding of what sorts of restrictions permit tractability in this challenging setting. To resolve this gap, we consider a generalization of the stochastic multi armed bandit, which we call the \\emph{tallying bandit}. This is an online learning setting with an $m$-memory bounded adversary, where the average loss for playing an action is an unknown function of the number (or tally) of times that the action was played in the last $m$ timesteps.

Partially observable RL is notoriously difficult in theoryâ€”well-known complexity-theoretic results show that learning partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) requires an exponential number of samples in the worst case. Yet, this does not rule out the possible existence of interesting subclasses of POMDPs, which include a large set of partial observable applications in practice while being tractable. In this paper we identify a rich family of tractable POMDPs, which we call weakly revealing POMDPs. This family rules out the pathological instances of POMDPs with non-informative observations. We prove that for weakly revealing POMDPs, a simple algorithm combining optimism and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is sufficient to guarantee a polynomial sample complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first provably sample-efficient result for learning in overcomplete POMDPsâ€”where the number of latent states can be larger than the number of observationsâ€”in settings where exploration is necessary."

In this work, we develop robust learning methods that tolerate general semi-random noise obtaining qualitatively the same guarantees as the best possible methods in the fully-random model. More specifically, given a set of n points with an unknown underlying partition, we are allowed to query pairs of points u,v to check if they are in the same cluster, but with probability p, the answer may be adversarially chosen. We show that information theoretically O(nk log n /(1-2p)^2) queries suffice to learn any cluster of sufficiently large size. Our main result is a computationally efficient algorithm that can identify large clusters with O(nk log n/ (1-2p)^2) + poly(log n, k, 1/(1-2p)) queries, matching the guarantees of the best known algorithms in the fully-random model. As a corollary of our approach, we develop the first parameter-free algorithm for the fully-random model, answering an open question in Mazumdar and Saha (2017a)."

Alternative approaches such as Projected Gradient Descent only provide a computational benefit for simple convex sets where Euclidean projections can be performed efficiently, such as Euclidean balls. For other more complex sets, the cost of the projections can be too high. To circumvent these issues, alternative methods based on the famous Frank-Wolfe algorithm have been studied and widely used. Such methods use a Linear Optimization Oracle at each iteration instead of Euclidean projections; the former can often be performed efficiently. Such methods have also been extended to the online and stochastic optimization settings. However, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants do not achieve the optimal performance, in terms of regret or rate, for general convex sets. What is more, the Linear Optimization Oracle they use can still be computationally expensive in some cases. In this paper, we move away from Frank-Wolfe style algorithms and present a new reduction that turns any algorithm $\\mathsf{A}$ over a Euclidean ball (where projections are cheap) to an algorithm over a general convex constraint set $\\mathcal{C}$ contained within the ball, without sacrificing the performance of the original algorithm $\\mathsf{A}$ by much. Our reduction requires $O(T \\ln T)$ calls to a Membership Oracle on $\\mathcal{C}$ after $T$ rounds, and no linear optimization on $\\K$ is needed. Using this reduction, we recover optimal regret bounds [resp. rates], in terms of the number of iterations, in online [resp. stochastic] convex optimization. Our guarantees are also useful in the offline convex optimization setting when the dimension of the ambient space is large."

We also demonstrate that these representations allow for efficient transfer learning, which is impossible in the kernel regime. Specifically, we consider the problem of learning polynomials which depend on only a few relevant directions, i.e. of the form $f^\\star(x) = g(Ux)$ where $U: \\R^d \\to \\R^r$ with $d \\gg r$. When the degree of $f^\\star$ is $p$, it is known that $n \\asymp d^p$ samples are necessary to learn $f^\\star$ in the kernel regime.

In this paper, we build on the recent work by Luo et al. 2018 and present the first practical online portfolio selection algorithm with a logarithmic regret and whose per-round time and space complexities depend only logarithmically on the horizon.

In our main technical result, we show that an exchange inequality, a concept rooted in discrete convex analysis, can be derived from fast mixing of local random walks. We further advance the state of the art on the mixing of random walks for nonsymmetric DPPs and more generally sector-stable distributions, by obtaining the tightest possible bound on the step size needed for polynomial-time mixing of random walks. We bring the step size down by a factor of $2$ compared to prior works, and consequently get a quadratic improvement on the runtime of local search steps; this improvement is potentially of independent interest in sampling applications."

The previous fastest algorithm for this problem ran in quasipolynomial time, a consequence of \\cite{EH89}s classic algorithm for the distribution-free setting. In this article we highlight the natural open problem of obtaining a polynomial-time algorithm, discuss possible avenues towards obtaining it, and state intermediate milestones that we believe are of independent interest."

      "abstract": "Kernel-based bandit is an extensively studied black-box optimization problem, in which the objective function is assumed to live in a known reproducing kernel Hilbert space. While nearly optimal regret bounds (up to logarithmic factors) are established in the noisy setting, surprisingly, less is known about the noise-free setting (when the exact values of the underlying function is accessible without observation noise). We discuss several upper bounds on regret; none of which seem order optimal, and provide a conjecture on the order optimal regret bound."

      "abstract": "The results in Google Search, Twitter and other popular search engines traditionally utilize the Personalized PageRank (PPR) vector to rank the results in their search engines. Additionally, there is a plethora of applications beyond the web~\\citep{G15} which are modelled using PPR. In recent work by~\\cite{ACL06,GM14_ICML,fountoulakis2019variational}, it was shown that small probabilities in PPR vector, e.g., web pages beyond the first page in Google Search, can be thresholded out automatically by utilizing $\\ell_1$-regularization or equivalently by early termination. Both versions result in approximate computation of PPR. The current fastest method for computing the $\\ell_1$-regularized PPR uses proximal gradient method and requires $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}((\\alpha \\rho)^{-1})$ total running time, where $\\alpha$ is the teleportation parameter and $\\rho$ is a parameter which controls the level of sparsity in the $\\ell_1$-regularized PPR. It is important to note that the running time complexity does not depend on the size of the underlying graph (e.g. the length of the PPR vector). Such property has become a prerequisite to probe modern large scale networks. A seemingly natural way to build an even faster algorithm for computing the $\\ell_1$-regularized PPR is to accelerate the proximal gradient method and consequently reduce the running time complexity to $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}((\\sqrt{\\alpha} \\rho)^{-1})$. This will lead to a speed-up by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ and improve the running time of various network analytic methods which build upon PPR. However, the original analysis of the proximal gradient method in~\\cite{fountoulakis2019variational} does not apply to the accelerated version. While we have empirical evidence that indicates accelerated proximal gradient requires less total running time, it is not even clear if acceleration could lead to a worse running time complexity in the worst case."

Thus, defining problems which are online differentially privately learnable is of great interest in learning theory. In this paper, we pose the question on if the two problems are equivalent from a learning perspective, i.e., is privacy for free in the online learning framework?"

      "abstract": "The design of efficient differentially private (DP) learning algorithms with dimension-independent learning guarantees has been one of the central challenges in the field of privacy-preserving machine learning. Existing algorithms either suffer from weak generalization guarantees, restrictive model assumptions, or quite large computation cost. In non-private learning, dimension-independent generalization guarantees based on the notion of confidence margin were shown to be the most informative and useful learning guarantees. This motivates a systematic study of DP learning algorithms with confidence-margin generalization guarantees. A recent work has started exploring this direction in the context of linear and kernel-based classification as well as certain classes of neural networks (NNs). Despite showing several positive results, a number of fundamental questions are still open. We identify two major open problems related to DP margin-based learning algorithms. The first problem relates to the design of algorithms with more favorable computational cost. The second one pertains to the question of achieving margin guarantees for NNs under DP with no explicit dependence on the network size."

Such regret bounds are known to be tight up to lower order terms in the setting of Gaussian rewards (Garivier et al., 2019). We revisit the related problem of stochastic online learning with feedback graphs, where asymptotically optimal instance dependent algorithms are known. Surprisingly, the notion of optimal finite-time regret is not a uniquely defined property in this context and in general, it is decoupled from the asymptotic rate. We pose two open problems. First we ask for a characterization of the finite time instance-dependent optimal regret. Next, we ask for a characterization of the set of graphs for which the finite time regret is bounded by the asymptotically optimal rate, for reasonable values of the time horizon."

For any bandit instance with a unique best arm, its asymptotic complexity in the so-called fixed-confidence setting has been completely characterized in Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) and Chernoff (1959), while little is known about the asymptotic complexity in its â€œdualâ€� setting called fixed-budget setting. This note discusses the open problems and conjectures about the instance-dependent asymptotic complexity in the fixed-budget setting."
